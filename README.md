# Axel Vanhessche Portfolio


## ðŸ“¸ Glimpses of the Axel Vanhessche Portfolio Clone

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview:
Axel Vanhessche's portfolio (https://axelvanhessche.com/) stands as an Awwwards-awarded website celebrated for its concise layout and the innovative use of SVG masks to showcase projects. Inspired by its minimalist yet effective design principles, I undertook the challenge to recreate this frontend project. The goal was to capture its simplicity, well-structured interface, and compelling visual effects.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

- HTML: Used for structuring the site.
- CSS: Employed for design, including micro-animations and responsive layouts.
- JavaScript and Libraries:
    - GSAP: Utilized for major animations.
    - Locomotive Scroll: Implemented for smooth scrolling and precise control over scroll speed.
    - ScrollTrigger: Integrated extensively for custom scroll-based animations, such as animating the navbar logo and name, and manipulating SVG masks for project displays.
      
## ðŸ“š Learning Experience:

This project provided a valuable opportunity to delve deeper into ScrollTrigger and its powerful capabilities in creating interactive and user-friendly experiences. The challenges included replicating the loader animations and animating SVGs, which expanded my skills in frontend development and animation.
